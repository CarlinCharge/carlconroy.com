# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

** My name is Carl **

I've been building software since 2016. When I got started I began with Ruby/Ruby on Rails but these days
I build entire applications using React and a wealth of tools to manage the backend quickly.

You can find some of my recent work in the <PostLink to="/ComingSoon"> Projects</PostLink> including the details on
how I built <PostLink to="/">this website</PostLink> from concept to completed product.

Technical communication and design are important when it comes to bringing an application or website to life.
I use Figma to design UI and produce mockups to effectively establish unified vision.

From there I can scaffold a system using primarily React as a development framework in tandem with
the tools I see fit for the job. These technoligies include Next.js, Gatsby, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, REST API design,
Apollo Client and GraphQL.

I have my own production company. Primarily I have been a wedding filmmaker but I have done a variety of commercial work as well.
